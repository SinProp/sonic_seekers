[REQUIRED] Project Description: I'm going to build an application that allows for users to find musicians in their area to collaborate with 
Or hire for gig work. Users will be required to name their top 2 genres of choice, and whether or not they accept work or opportunities outside that genre.
They'll also be able to list up to 3 of their most prominent skills.  

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: I didn't utilize Login and Registration within the mean course, so I'm looking to implement 
It here. I'm also looking to utilize Bootstrap to get a nice orderly looking result that is easy on the eyes.
